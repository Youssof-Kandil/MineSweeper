# MineSweeper
AI module for a minesweeper robot in Haskell. The environment in which the robot operates is an 4 Ã— 4 grid of cells where cells can have mines. The objective of the AI module is to compute a sequence of actions that the robot can follow in order to go to all the mines and collect them.
